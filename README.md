# Messages App

A fullstack direct messaging application created for study and practice purposes. The project focuses on learning modern web development concepts, including authentication, client–server communication, and fullstack architecture.

## Overview

This application simulates a direct messaging system where users can create accounts, log in, and exchange messages. The main goal of the project is educational: to explore how frontend and backend systems communicate and how authentication and data flow are handled in a real-world structure.

The project is built using:

* **Frontend:** React
* **Backend:** C# with ASP.NET
* **Architecture:** Fullstack (separate frontend and backend)
* **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Token)

## Features

* User signup and login
* JWT-based authentication
* Protected routes
* Direct messaging structure (in progress)
* Client–server communication via REST API

## Project Structure

```
/frontend   -> React application
/backend    -> ASP.NET API
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```

## Learning Goals

This project is intended to practice:

* React component structure and routing
* API integration using HTTP requests
* Authentication with JWT
* Backend API development with ASP.NET
* Fullstack application design
* State management and protected routes

## Status

This project is under active development and is intended for learning and experimentation rather than production use.
